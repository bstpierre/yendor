Yendor Defender
===============

Story
-----

The dungeons of Yendor are facing a coordinated assault from
above-ground forces bent on killing Rodney and/or stealing the Amulet
of Yendor. The enemy managed to penetrate every level of the dungeons
before Rodney could get his act together and put together a coherent
eradication strategy.

The player is fresh out of Wizard School, and is initially responsible
for repelling the waves of attackers entering the topmost
dungeon. Successful defense of this dungeon will stop more attackers
from flooding into lower dungeons. When the player succeeds at this,
Rodney will notice and promote him to drive out the attackers from
increasingly deep dungeons.

(The details of some of the story info below still need to be worked
out.)

Killed enemies provide gold, XP, and/or power. Gold can be used to
purchase new towers. Power can be used to enhance/upgrade towers.

XP will eventually be useful somehow :)
